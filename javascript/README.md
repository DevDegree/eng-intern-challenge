# JavaScript Instructions

Here is my JavaScript solution to the Shopify Engineering Intern Challenge Fall-Winter 2025.

I initially built this using a functional programming approach, mostly due to familiarity with the style through past personal projects and Bootcamp lessons.

I ended up refactoring this to a more Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach because the encapsulation could potentially make it more maintainable and futureproof. Also, I realized the other programming language choices were OOP-focused, so I didn't want to get left out...

In this particular case, the functional programming approach was actually compiling slightly faster than the OOP because of its relative simplicity and constant objects (mappings). The OOP would probably make more sense in larger codebases, or if Translator was to be extended to some other functionality somewhere else.

In retrospect, TypeScript or Ruby may be a good alternative for future cases like this.

Thank you for providing the opportunity to complete this challenge! I had fun building this project and learning about Braille!

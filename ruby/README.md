# Braille Translator
A Ruby-based Braille translator that converts English text to Braille and vice versa. It supports uppercase letters, digits, and spaces, making it suitable for basic Braille translation tasks.

## Features
English to Braille Translation: Converts English text, including uppercase letters and numbers, into Braille.
Braille to English Translation: Converts Braille-encoded strings back into English text, recognizing uppercase letters and numbers.
Automatic Mode Detection: Automatically determines if the input is Braille or English and translates accordingly.
Usage
Command-Line Interface
To use the Braille translator from the command line, provide the text or Braille string as an argument:

ruby translator.rb "<braille/plain formatted text>"

## Examples:

### Translate English text to Braille
ruby translator.rb "Hello 123"

### Translate Braille back to English
ruby translator.rb "O.....O.OO..O.O... .O.OOO .OO.....O"

### Output
The program outputs the corresponding translation (either Braille or English text) directly to the console.

Alphabet Mapping
The translator supports the following Braille representations for lowercase English letters:

Numbers are preceded by a special Braille character: .O.OOO.
